For Loops

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable, and are created using square brackets (see below). Let's learn through the following example:
"""
websites = ["facebook.com", "google.com", "amazon.com"]
for site in websites:
     print(site)
